# A collection of examples of new features in Java 8

This is a collection of very basic/simple examples of features introduced in Java 8. It's a work in progress, and I'd be adding more examples as and when I find more time for it.

As of now, there isn't much to know about building/running these samples, however it should be pretty straightforward. I might think of introducing a tool to build it and run specific examples rather than having to rely on IntelliJ Idea to do that for you.
